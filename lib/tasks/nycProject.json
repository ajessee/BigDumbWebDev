Taking a picture a day has forced me to keep my eyes open and look for the beauty in this world that sometimes seems so ugly.\n\nOne trip around the sun seems like a long time while you are living it, but it's over in the blink of an eye. Here is to a brand new year filled with love and possibility, and to finding beauty and fulfillment in your lives. \nSending love from my my world to yours. Happy New Year.",
