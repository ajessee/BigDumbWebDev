Hi <%= @user.first_name %>

Sorry you're having trouble with your password. Let's get that reset for you.

Click <%= link_to "here", edit_password_reset_url(@user.reset_token, email: @user.email) %> to reset your password.

For your security, this link will only be valid for 15 minutes.

If you did not request this password reset, just ignore this email and your password will stay the same.
