    <p>Hi, my name is Andr√©, and I live in Washington D.C. I work as a software engineer for the American Institutes for Research,
      a non-profit. In my spare time I like to code and build web applications like this one.</p>

    <p>I started on my journey to learn how to code a few years ago. At the time I was working as a project manager for a small
      international development company. The projects I managed were climate change related monitoring and evaluation contracts
      with the U.S. Department of State. I got the opportunity to travel and do some field work. I realized that I wanted
      to develop a robust technical skill set around data collection, storage, analysis, and visualization. </p>

    <p>I moved up to NYC and enrolled in Dev Bootcamp, an intensive technical training program where we learned a number of
      different technologies. After graduating, I stayed in NYC and worked for Kaplan for a couple years before moving back
      to DC.</p>

    <p>I've been continuing my learning since, focusing on coding in Ruby and Javascript, and building web applications in Rails.
      I'm building this site as a place where I can exhibit projects that I have been working on, and share my knowledge
      and thoughts through a blog. This site is currently under construction, so please excuse my dust! I plan on continuing
      to add more projects that I am working on, while at the same time getting my blog up and running. So keep coming back
      to check for new content. In the meantime, feel free to checkout my GitHub, LinkedIn, or Creddle pages below. Also,
      keep scrolling to checkout my projects.</p>

    <p>Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to drop me a line at any time!</p>
