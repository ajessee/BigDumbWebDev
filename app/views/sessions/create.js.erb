  Here we check if we've stored a forwarded location
  This means that the user had tried to access a part of the site they weren't authorized to (they hadn't logged in), but we stored the URL of where they were trying to go.
  If we have a stored location, we make an AJAX call to the sessions controller and set a forwarding_needed class variable that indicates that we are redirecting the user to that stored location
  This is called friendly forwarding, which is just a convience for the user. Once we window.location.replace with the stored location, then in notifications.js, on DOMContentLoaded we made a
  AJAX call to the server and see if that forwarding_needed class variable is true, and if so, we give the user a notification that we've forwarded them to where they initally intented to go.
  Whew, this is a lot and probably an overcomplication.
